    ### **Input:**
    
    **Resume Text**:
    ${resumeText}
    
    **Job Description**:
    ${jobDescription}
    
    ---
    
    ### **Your Output Format:**
    
    1. **Lines That Should Be Changed**:  
       Identify specific lines in the resume that do not fully align with the job description. For each line:
       - Present the **original line**.
       - Provide a **revised version** that better matches the job description requirements.
    
       Format Example:  
       - Original: "<Original Line>"  
       - Revised: "<Revised Line>"  
    
    ---
    
    2. **Recommended Additions**:  
       Suggest specific skills, projects, achievements, or experiences that are **missing** from the resume but are critical to match the job description. Be specific and actionable.  
    
       Example:  
       - Add a section that highlights experience with [specific skill or tool].
       - Include a quantifiable achievement such as "<achieved X outcome by doing Y>."
    
    ---
    
    3. **Concepts to Learn or Prepare**:  
       List the most relevant skills, technologies, or concepts the candidate should focus on learning or preparing for to be a strong fit for the role. Be concise and actionable.  
    
       Example:  
       - Learn about [technology/tool] to meet the role's technical requirements.
       - Practice [specific skill] to improve alignment with the responsibilities of the job.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Instructions**:
    - Tailor all suggestions specifically to the provided job description.  
    - Keep your output clear, concise, and actionable.  
    - Do not include explanations or generic adviceâ€”focus on concrete recommendations.
